    <h2>Introduction of C Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be used to produce various types of output, including software applications, scripts, and algorithms. Programming languages allow developers to communicate with computers, enabling them to perform tasks and solve problems efficiently. They can be categorized into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low-Level Languages: Closer to machine code (e.g., Assembly).</li>
        <li>High-Level Languages: Closer to human language (e.g., Python, Java).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is C?</h3>
    <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has influenced many modern programming languages and remains widely used for system and application software development.</p>

    <h3>History of C</h3>
    <p>The C programming language was developed as an evolution of the B language, itself derived from BCPL, by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. Initially, C was used to implement the UNIX operating system. Its combination of low-level access to memory and high-level features made it widely popular. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published "The C Programming Language," which further popularized C and standardized many of its features. In 1989, ANSI standardized C, leading to the creation of C89, followed by the C99 standard which introduced several new features, including inline functions and variable-length arrays.</p>

    <h3>Features of C</h3>
    <p>C has several features that make it a powerful and flexible programming language:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple and Efficient: C has a straightforward syntax that is easy to learn and use.</li>
        <li>Structured Programming: C encourages modular programming through functions, making code easier to understand and maintain.</li>
        <li>Portability: C code can be compiled on various hardware platforms with minimal changes.</li>
        <li>Low-Level Access: C allows manipulation of hardware through pointers, enabling efficient resource management.</li>
        <li>Rich Library: C provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries for various operations.</li>
        <li>Recursion: C supports recursive functions, allowing functions to call themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where is C Used?</h3>
    <p>C is used in various domains due to its versatility and performance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System Programming: Operating systems (e.g., UNIX), device drivers, and embedded systems.</li>
        <li>Application Development: Software applications, game development, and graphical applications.</li>
        <li>Database Systems: Developing database management systems (e.g., MySQL).</li>
        <li>Networking: Network programming and protocols.</li>
        <li>Compilers and Interpreters: Implementing programming languages and interpreters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Learn C?</h3>
    <p>Learning C provides several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Foundation for Other Languages: Understanding C helps in learning other programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.</li>
        <li>Performance: C provides low-level memory access, allowing for high-performance applications.</li>
        <li>Industry Relevance: C is still widely used in the industry, especially in systems programming and embedded systems.</li>
        <li>Community Support: C has a large community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find help and resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Syntax and Structure of C</h2>
    <p>The basic structure of a C program includes the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preprocessor Directives: Instructions for the preprocessor (e.g., #include).</li>
        <li>Main Function: The entry point of the program, where execution begins.</li>
        <li>Declarations: Variables and function declarations.</li>
        <li>Statements: The actual instructions executed by the program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example of a Simple C Program</h3>
    <pre>
<span class="keyword">#include</span> &lt;<span class="string">stdio.h</span>&gt; <span class="comment">// Preprocessor directive</span>

<span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="keyword">main</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">printf</span>(<span class="string">"Hello, World!\n"</span>); <span class="comment">// Print message to the console</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> 0; <span class="comment">// Exit status</span>
}
    </pre>
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="keyword">#include</span> &lt;<span class="string">stdio.h</span>&gt;: This directive tells the compiler to include the standard input-output library, which is necessary for using functions like <span class="keyword">printf</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword">int main</span>(): This defines the main function where the program execution begins. Every C program must have a <span class="keyword">main</span> function.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword">printf</span>(<span class="string">"Hello, World!\n"</span>): This line calls the <span class="keyword">printf</span> function to output the text "Hello, World!" followed by a new line to the console.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword">return</span> 0;: This line indicates that the program has finished successfully, returning 0 to the operating system.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>C is a powerful and versatile programming language that serves as a foundation for many modern languages and applications. Its features, portability, and performance make it an excellent choice for system-level programming and application development. By understanding C, you can gain valuable skills that are applicable in various fields of software development.</p>
